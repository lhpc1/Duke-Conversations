  <p> Hi {}, </p>
  <!-- User.name, day (of the week) -->
  <p> My name is {} and I will be organizing our dinner next {}.
    Please read this email carefully as it will provide

  <p> <strong> Transportation and Timing </strong> </p>
  <p> Duke Conversations provides free transportation for all dinner participants.
      Please meet in front of the Physics Building (on Science Drive) at <strong> <font size = "10"> 6 P.M. </font> </strong> so that we can start the dinner on time at 6:30.
       If you are late to the meeting point and are left behind, you will be responsible for your own transportation.
      If you would like to travel separately, please reply to this email to let me know! </p>

  <p> The dinner should wrap up between 8:00 - 8:15 PM, and we should be back on campus around 8:30 - 8:50,
      although these times are fluid and depend on when all the students want to leave.
      If you must be back on campus by a certain time, please let me know and I can make sure we end the conversation on time. </p>
